DECO3200 A4: Final Prototype

**Important Information**
1. When accessing this mobile web app from a desktop, please right-click on the browser and select 'Inspect.' Then, change the screen 'Dimensions' to 'iPhone 14 Pro Max.' The ideal screen width for using this mobile web app is 430px. This app is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed for mobile phone users. It's important to note that it is not programmed to be responsive. For the best viewing experience, please set the dimensions to 'iPhone 14 Pro Max.'

2. Before testing the mobile web app, please review the various flows outlined below. Not all buttons are functional in the app, as this MVP is intended for users to test all the flows as a prototype.

**Flow 1: Onboarding**

Users will first see a splash screen when they enter the web app. After the splash screen fades out, a carousel with three slides will appear, providing information about the app. Users can swipe horizontally to navigate between the slides or manually press the dot buttons at the bottom of the carousel. Once the user reaches the last slide, a "Get Started" call-to-action (CTA) button will be displayed. Upon clicking this button, the user will be taken to the Registration screen to create an account. After pressing the "Create Account" CTA button, the user will proceed to the "Add Your Card" screen. Once the user reviews the information on this screen and clicks the "Agree and Continue" button, they will be directed to the "Add Card Information" screen. After entering their card details, users can click the "Add and Continue" CTA button to proceed to the Home screen.

**Flow 2: Meal Planning**

At the initial 'Home' screen, it appears empty because no 'Meal Plans' have been created yet. The user can tap the '+' icon in the bottom right corner of the screen and select 'Create New Meal Plan'. This action directs the user to the 'Create Your Meal Plan' screen, which features 3 recipes. Users can select one or more recipes and then click the 'Preview Groceries' button to navigate to the 'Preview Groceries' screen. The chosen recipes and their respective ingredients will be dynamically populated in this screen based on the user's choices. On the 'Preview Groceries' screen, users can edit the units of measurement for individual ingredients by tapping the 'pencil' icon. However, for this prototype, only the first 'pencil' icon associated with the first ingredient of the first recipe is functional. When the 'pencil' icon is selected, a bottom sheet will slide up from the bottom of the screen, allowing the user to make edits. In this prototype, users cannot edit the ingredients. The bottom sheet will slide down when the user selects the 'Done' button. Once the user is finished, they can select the 'Add Recipes to Plan' button to proceed to the 'Shopping List' screen, which also serves as the updated 'Home' screen.

**Flow 3: Shopping List** (with 'adding a grocery beyond the plan' option)

The recipe and ingredients displayed on the updated 'Home' screen are dynamically populated based on the user's input from the previous screen. On this screen, users also have the option to add a grocery item that is not part of their plan by selecting the 'Add' button. Additionally, when users check off each ingredient in the shopping list using the checkbox, the list will be marked as complete, and they will automatically be redirected back to the initial home screen.

**Flow 4: Track Food Wastage**

When the user is at the initial home screen, the user can select the 'Track' navigation option via the bottom navigation bar. The user will then be directed to the 'Track Food Wastage' screen. On this screen, the user can track the amount of food wasted (in kilograms) and the amount of money saved (in dollars). However, the initial values for both are zero. Users can select the 'Record my food waste' option on this screen and will be directed to the next screen to calculate how much food was wasted. For demo purposes, there is a '+' icon for every ingredient; however, only the first '+' icon of the first ingredient can be selected for this prototype. When the user selects the '+' icon, the user should be able to edit the value in 'percentage %' wise, and upon pressing 'Done', the amount of food (in grams/kilograms) will automatically be updated accordingly. Then, when the user presses the 'See Summary' option, the user will be directed to the 'Calculated Summary' screen, where the amount of food (in grams/kilograms) and the cost of each ingredient (in dollars) will automatically be updated accordingly. Then, when the user presses the 'Continue' CTA button, the user will be directed to the updated 'Track Food Wastage' initial screen with updated values. Hence, the user can track how much food they wasted and how much money they saved.

**Flow 5: Dynamic Food Portioning**

At the initial 'Home' screen, it appears empty because no 'Meal Plans' have been created yet. The user can tap the '+' icon in the bottom right corner of the screen and select 'Import past meal plans'. This action directs the user to the 'Past Meal Plans' screen, which features 1 recipe (for demo purposes for this prototype only). Users can select the recipe and press the 'Import recipe' button. A bottom sheet with 2 options ('Apply and Preview' and 'No, import as it is') will slide up from the bottom of the screen. When the user selects the 'Apply and Preview' option, the user will be directed to the 'Preview Groceries' screen. On this screen, the user can check the groceries generated based on the recipe selected on the previous screen and add the recipe to the plan by pressing the 'Add recipe to plan' CTA button. Then, the user is supposed to be directed to the updated 'Home' screen with the imported recipe. However, for this prototype, this is not implemented as it is a similar flow to Flow 2: Meal Planning, which had already been implemented.
